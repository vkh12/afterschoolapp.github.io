# AfterSchool App Website
<br>
<b>OVERVIEW</b><br>
This app concept is done in part of completing the 2022 Rielly Douglass BOLD Externship program with Microsoft. The prompt is to “create a product to encourage, inspire, and empower students to find new ways to connect with each other during a global pandemic”. 

<br><b>TIMELINE</b><br>
January 4 - 14, 2022 (2 weeks)

<br><b>CONTRIBUTION</b><br>
I coordinated this project and my responsibilities included understanding the overall landscape, ideating solutions, designing the brand identity, conducting user interviews, and prototyping.

<br><b>THE SOLUTION</b><br>
An app that allows students to explore and join opportunities (student organizations and events), communicate to other students and coordinators, and manage their responsibilities (i.e. participation in multiple student organizations and completion of tasks).
